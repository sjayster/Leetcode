"""
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Solutions:

1. Dictionary
Create a dict with number as key and count as value
Store the max(d.values()) in a var
Iterate over the dict and return the key, if d[key] == max(d.values())

2. Using count keyword - but this would lead to time limit exceeded error if the array is really huge

3. No extra space 0(n) time 
Have 2 variables, major and count = 0.
Iterate over the list. We know that majority element will be present more than 50% times in the array.
If count == 0, then set majority element as current num
else if count >0 and if current num != majority element, decrement count
else, increment count

4. Got few more ideas from here:
